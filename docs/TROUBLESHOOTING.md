## Display Stays Black After Flashing (Waveshare 1.64 V2)

**Applies to:** ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-1.64 boards that still accept firmware and produce serial/BLE diagnostics, but show no pixels after Smart Grind starts.

### Symptoms
- The display worked with the factory firmware, then became completely black after flashing Smart Grind.
- The device still boots, connects, or produces a diagnostic report.
- Reflashing the official V2 demo restores the display.

### Root Cause
Waveshare's V2 revision is not display-compatible with the original board. It uses an SH8601 panel controller, GPIO 46 for display chip select, a 40 MHz QSPI bus, and a 20-pixel X offset. The original V1 target uses a different display path and can boot successfully without lighting a V2 panel.

### Confirm the Revision
Do **not** identify this display generation from the PCB revision text alone. A physically verified newer SH8601 board is silkscreened `Rev1.1`, despite requiring what this project calls the V2 firmware and wiring. The V1/V2 names in this project distinguish incompatible display generations, not a reliable marking printed on the PCB.

Flash Waveshare's [official V2 demo](https://github.com/waveshareteam/ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-1.64-v2). If that works but the original CO5300 demo or normal V1 Smart Grind image remains black, treat the board as the newer SH8601 generation and use the V2 target. Do this test before connecting the grinder wiring so display compatibility is isolated from the rest of the installation.

### Resolution
Build and flash the V2 firmware over USB, in a shell with ESP-IDF activated
(see [Initial USB Flashing](DEVELOPMENT.md#initial-usb-flashing)):

```bash
python3 tools/grinder.py build --hardware v2
idf.py -B build/v2 -p <port> flash
```

For a complete V2 installation, wire HX711 SCK to GPIO 1 and the grinder motor-control lead to GPIO 16. GPIO 18 is connected to the V2 touchscreen interrupt (`TP_INT`) and must not be used for motor control. The V1 connections remain HX711 SCK on GPIO 2 and motor control on GPIO 18.

Do not change only the chip-select pin in a V1 build. Both revisions drive the panel through `esp_lcd`, but they are different controllers with different power-on sequences: V1 is a CO5300 and V2 an SH8601. Changing the pin without the matching driver and initialization sequence leaves the panel black.

If using the Web Flasher, select **Newer SH8601 (V2 firmware; may say Rev1.1)** for this generation. Do not select the original CO5300 image merely because the PCB says `Rev1.1`.

## Motor Does Not Start

**Applies to:** Eureka Mignon installations where the grinder motor does not activate when commanded.

### Symptoms
- Motor test function (Menu → Motor Test) does not start the motor
- GRIND button does not start the motor
- All other functionality works normally (screen, weight readings, etc.)

**Note:** If you hear a click and humming sound but no coffee grounds come out, the motor **is** starting correctly - your grinder is clogged, not a wiring issue.

### Root Cause
The motor control wire (Pin 3) and button signal wire (Pin 2) from the Eureka 4-pin plug may be reversed on the Waveshare board connection. The button signal wire does not control the motor.

### Diagnosis

**Option 1: Use Motor Test Function (Recommended)**

Access **Menu → Motor Test** (Tools section) to verify motor connectivity. This button activates the motor for a short test pulse. If the motor does not run during the test, the motor wire is incorrectly connected.

**Option 2: Manual Wire Identification (Advanced - Use with Extreme Caution)**

⚠️ **DANGER:** This test involves live wires and can cause the grinder to start unexpectedly, potentially causing injury or damage. Only attempt if comfortable working with electrical systems.

Using the 4-pin Eureka plug pinout (see `../media/4-pin_Eureka_plug_pinout.png` in documentation):
- **Pin 1**: 5V power supply
- **Pin 2**: Button signal (unused in this project)
- **Pin 3**: Motor control signal *(active-high — motor engages when driven to 3.3-5V)*
- **Pin 4**: Ground

The motor control wire (Pin 3) is the wire that **starts the motor when briefly driven HIGH (touch it to Pin 1 / 5V)**. Test carefully:
1. Ensure grinder is powered and hopper has minimal beans
2. Disconnect the suspect wire from the Waveshare board
3. Briefly touch the wire to 5V (Pin 1) - motor should start
4. **Be prepared for the powerful motor to cause the grinder to twist/jump**
5. **Avoid shorts that could damage the board or cause injury**

### Resolution

**Swap the wire connections:**
- The motor control wire (Pin 3) should connect to Waveshare **GPIO 18 on V1** or **GPIO 16 on V2**
- The button signal wire (Pin 2) can remain disconnected (unused in this project)

If wires were reversed, swap them so Pin 3 connects to the correct GPIO for the board revision. On V2, never use GPIO 18 for motor control because it is shared with `TP_INT`. The Waveshare board has reverse polarity protection for power connections, but the motor/button wires should be correctly identified for proper operation.

**Important:** Wire colors vary significantly between Eureka units - always refer to pin positions rather than wire colors when troubleshooting. On the physically verified V2 Specialita, Pin 3 was the grey lead and Pin 2 was white, contrary to the earlier assumed assignment; the white Pin 2 lead was left disconnected and insulated.

## HX711 Not Detected / Wrong Sample Rate

**Applies to:** First-boot issues when the load cell board is missing, miswired, or strapped for 80 SPS.

### Symptoms
- Startup log shows `HX711_NOT_CONNECTED` or `HX711_SAMPLE_RATE_INVALID`.
- Weight display stays at `0.00 g`; grinding and calibration remain disabled.

### Quick Fixes
- **NOT_CONNECTED:** Verify VCC/GND/SCK/DOUT wiring and that the HX711 board is powered.
- **SAMPLE_RATE_INVALID:** Ensure the HX711 `RATE` pin is tied to GND for 10 SPS; a floating/high pin forces 80 SPS and will now block startup.
- After correcting hardware, reboot the scale. The diagnostic clears automatically when healthy samples are detected.

---

## Suspected HX711 or Load Cell Damage

**Applies to:** A reversed connector, short circuit, overheated HX711 module, or
a scale that stopped responding immediately after a wiring mistake.

> [!CAUTION]
> Disconnect the grinder from mains power before opening it. Remove USB power
> and any battery connection before moving wires or measuring resistance. Do
> not reconnect an HX711 module that became unusually hot; a damaged module can
> place another fault on the ESP32's 3.3 V rail.

### What the symptoms establish

- An HX711 IC that became too hot to touch after a reversed connection should
  be treated as failed and replaced, even if it later appears to cool normally.
- A four-wire load cell is a passive Wheatstone bridge and will often survive a
  fault on the ESP32-to-HX711 cable, but this is not guaranteed.
- An ESP32 that still boots, runs the display and controls the motor is broadly
  functional, but those tests do not prove that its HX711 GPIO pins survived.
- `HX711_NOT_CONNECTED` means the firmware received no valid samples. It cannot
  distinguish a failed HX711, broken load cell, damaged GPIO or bad wiring by
  itself.

### Isolate the components

1. **Remove the suspect HX711.** Photograph and label every connection first,
   then disconnect both the ESP32 cable and load cell. Check for a cracked IC,
   discolouration, lifted tracks or a burnt smell. Do not use this module for
   further testing if it overheated.
2. **Check the disconnected load cell with a multimeter.** Use its datasheet or
   the documented wiring labels rather than relying only on wire colours.
   Measure resistance across the excitation pair (`E+` to `E-`) and signal pair
   (`A+` to `A-`). Both readings should be finite, stable and normally in the
   hundreds of ohms. An open circuit or near-short indicates a damaged cable or
   bridge. The two values need not be identical because load cells can contain
   compensation resistors.
3. **Check insulation.** With the load cell still disconnected, there should be
   no low-resistance continuity from any of its four bridge wires to the metal
   body or cable shield. The shield itself is excluded from this test.
4. **Fit a known-good replacement HX711.** Verify all four ESP32 connections
   before applying power: V1 uses GPIO 2 for SCK and GPIO 3 for DOUT; V2 uses
   GPIO 1 for SCK and GPIO 3 for DOUT. VCC is 3.3 V and GND is GND. Perform the
   first test with the grinder disconnected from mains and the motor-control
   lead disconnected and insulated; USB power is sufficient to test the scale.
5. **Interpret the result.** If valid readings return, recalibrate and the ESP32
   and load cell have passed the practical test. If the new HX711 is still not
   detected, recheck the cable and pin mapping, then test with a known-good load
   cell or ESP32 board to isolate the remaining component. Do not keep swapping
   parts onto a module that overheats or pulls down the 3.3 V rail.

The normal wiring map is in
[Hardware and installation](HARDWARE_INSTALLATION.md#installation-and-wiring).
After installing the replacement, reboot and check **Menu → Diagnostics** or a
[diagnostic report](#getting-diagnostic-reports). A healthy 10 SPS HX711 clears
the hardware fault automatically; calibration is still required before weight
mode can grind.

### Temporary operation without a load cell

The maintained firmware can still operate the grinder while replacement scale
parts are in transit. Install the image that matches the display generation—in
particular, an original 1.64-inch V1/CO5300 board must use the **V1** image—then
use either:

- **Manual mode** for target-free start/stop operation with its independent
  30-second safety cutoff; or
- **Time mode** for a repeatable timed dose.

These modes control the motor through the normal guarded grind controller and
do not require a working HX711. Weight mode, live weight, tare, calibration,
start-on-cup and weight-based stopping remain unavailable until the scale is
repaired. The matching V1/V2 images are available from the
[Community Web Flasher](https://clinteastman.github.io/smart-grind-by-weight/).

The resistance checks above follow standard Wheatstone-bridge fault isolation:
compare excitation and signal resistance with the load-cell specification and
check insulation between the bridge, shield and body. See Analog Devices'
[bridge measurement overview](https://www.analog.com/en/resources/reference-designs/circuits-from-the-lab/cn0600.html)
and the [HX711 datasheet](https://datasheet.lcsc.com/lcsc/2011051703_Avia-Semicon-Xiamen-HX711_C43656.pdf)
for the underlying circuit and supply limits.

## ESP-IDF Build Issues

**Applies to:** Building, flashing or monitoring the firmware from source with
`tools/grinder.py` or `idf.py`. The toolchain setup is described in
[ESP-IDF Toolchain](DEVELOPMENT.md#esp-idf-toolchain).

### ESP-IDF is not set up in this shell

**Symptom:** `python3 tools/grinder.py build` stops with
`ESP-IDF is not set up in this shell`, or `idf.py` is not found.

**Resolution:** Activate ESP-IDF v5.5.5 in the current shell, check the version
and rebuild. Activation lasts only for that shell.

```bash
# EIM installation (Linux/macOS)
source ~/.espressif/tools/activate_idf_v5.5.5.sh

# Or a git installation
. ~/esp/esp-idf/export.sh

# Prints ESP-IDF v5.5.5
idf.py --version
```

On Windows, use the ESP-IDF PowerShell environment that EIM installs.

### Edited sdkconfig defaults have no effect

**Symptom:** A change to `sdkconfig.defaults` or a variant overlay
(`sdkconfig.defaults.v2`, `sdkconfig.defaults.debug`, `sdkconfig.defaults.mock`)
does not appear in the next build.

**Root Cause:** Each variant's `build/<variant>/sdkconfig` is generated on its
first build and reused as is afterwards.

**Resolution:** Delete that variant's sdkconfig, or remove every build
directory, and rebuild:

```bash
rm build/v2/sdkconfig
# Or remove every variant's build directory
python3 tools/grinder.py clean
```

### Managed component download fails

**Symptom:** The first build fails while resolving or downloading components
such as LVGL or NimBLE-C++, or reports a component version conflict.

**Resolution:** The ESP-IDF component manager downloads the versions pinned in
`src/idf_component.yml` into `managed_components/`. Delete the downloaded
copies and the lock file, then rebuild with network access:

```bash
rm -rf managed_components dependencies.lock
python3 tools/grinder.py build --hardware v1
```

### Touch I2C errors in the serial monitor

The firmware polls the touch controller over I2C, and idle polls NACK. It
suppresses these expected I2C errors itself
(`DEBUG_SUPPRESS_TOUCH_I2C_ERRORS` in `src/config/debug.h`), so
`idf.py monitor` needs no filter. Set the switch to `0` only when you need the
raw driver output.

---

## Unexpected Net Weight Error

**Applies to:** A weight grind stopping after a brief negative scale reading
even though the cup or portafilter is still in place.

Current firmware records the vessel weight immediately before tare. It only
treats a negative reading as vessel removal when the reading approaches that
full pre-tare weight and persists across several samples. Smaller isolated
negative spikes are ignored.

If the error still occurs, download the diagnostic log from the grinder web UI
and include the pre-tare reference, removal threshold and reported weight in a
GitHub issue.

---

## Grind Timeout Screen

**Applies to:** Grinder timing out during operation, showing timeout screen after 30 seconds.

### Symptoms
- Grinder reaches timeout screen during grinding cycle
- Long taring process (>10 seconds)
- Unstable weight readings

### Root Cause
Extended taring due to load cell noise prevents grinding from completing within 30-second limit.

### Diagnosis
Check **Menu → Diagnostics → "Noise Floor"** (see
[Diagnostics System](FIRMWARE_SETUP.md#diagnostics-system) for details). If
"Noise level: Too High" (red text) appears persistently, your load cell has
sustained noise issues that will cause slow taring (>2 seconds). A warning icon
(⚠) will appear in the top-right corner when sustained noise is detected.

### Resolution
1. **Check load cell wiring:**
   - Verify shielding wire connection per wiring diagram
   - Shorten load cell cables if possible
   - Ensure clean, solid connections

2. **Check calibration factor (reference examples only):**

   Calibration factors vary between individual load cells, but extreme deviations may indicate hardware issues. Check your calibration factor in **Menu → Diagnostics → Load Cell Status**. Example values from tested units:
   - **1KG T70 load cell**: ±4400 (example)
   - **0.3KG Mavin Load Cell**: ±6580 (example)

   **Note:** These are examples only and can differ significantly between load cells. Use them as rough reference points, not expected values.

3. **If wiring issues persist:**
   - Increase `GRIND_SCALE_SETTLING_TOLERANCE_G` parameter for more noise tolerance

## Unreliable Pulse Corrections

**Applies to:** Pulse corrections failing to produce grounds consistently, requiring multiple correction cycles.

### Symptoms
- Multiple pulse attempts needed to reach target weight
- Inconsistent grounds production during pulse phase
- Overshooting or undershooting target weight frequently

### Root Cause
Motor response latency mismatch between firmware settings and actual hardware characteristics. Default 50ms may not match your specific grinder's relay type (solid-state vs mechanical), voltage (110V vs 220V), or burr inertia.

### Resolution

**Recommended:** Use the Auto-Tune Motor Response feature to automatically calibrate optimal pulse duration for your hardware:

1. **Access auto-tune**: Menu → Tune Pulses (Tools section)
2. **Prepare system**:
   - Ensure beans are in hopper
   - Place dosing cup on scale
   - System will automatically tare
3. **Run calibration**: Process takes 1-2 minutes
   - Priming phase: 500ms pulse to position beans
   - Binary search: Finds minimum reliable pulse duration
   - Verification: Confirms 80%+ success rate across 5 test pulses
4. **Check result**: New motor latency value displayed on completion
   - Typical range: 30-200ms depending on hardware
   - Value saved automatically to device preferences
   - Displayed in **Menu → Diagnostics**

**Verify calibration**: Check **Menu → Diagnostics → Motor Latency** to see current value. Re-run auto-tune if you change grinders, modify relay hardware, or continue experiencing unreliable pulse corrections.

**Manual fallback:** If auto-tune fails, system reverts to safe 50ms default. Check grinder power connection, hopper bean level, and scale setup.

## Getting Diagnostic Reports

**Applies to:** Reporting issues on GitHub or troubleshooting system behavior.

### What is a Diagnostic Report?

The diagnostic report is a comprehensive text dump of your device's current state, including:
- Firmware version, build number, and git commit
- System information (uptime, CPU frequency, RAM, flash storage)
- All compile-time constants (grind settings, thresholds, timeouts)
- Runtime statistics (lifetime grinds, total weight)
- Load cell calibration status and noise diagnostics
- Motor latency settings
- Autotune results (if available)

This information helps identify configuration issues, hardware problems, or firmware bugs.

### How to Get a Diagnostic Report

#### Option 1: Web Flasher (Recommended)

1. Visit the **[Community Web Flasher Diagnostics Tool](https://clinteastman.github.io/smart-grind-by-weight/)**
2. Click the **"Diagnostics"** tab
3. Click **"Connect & Get Diagnostics"**
4. Select your device from the Bluetooth pairing dialog
5. Wait for the report to complete (~5-10 seconds)
6. Click **"Copy to Clipboard"** or **"Download Report"**
7. Paste the report into your GitHub issue

**Browser Requirements:** Chrome, Edge, or Opera on desktop/Android (Web Bluetooth API required)

#### Option 2: Command Line Tool

If you have the development environment set up:

```bash
# Get diagnostics and display in terminal
python3 tools/grinder.py diagnostics

# Save diagnostics to a file
python3 tools/grinder.py diagnostics --save diagnostics.txt
```

### When to Include a Diagnostic Report

**Always include a diagnostic report when reporting:**
- Grinding accuracy issues (overshooting/undershooting)
- Timeout errors or slow taring
- Load cell calibration problems
- Motor response issues
- Any unexpected behavior or crashes
- Feature requests that depend on your hardware configuration

**The diagnostic report is anonymous** and contains no personal information. It only includes technical device settings and statistics.

### Including Grind Results in Your Report

**For grind-related issues, follow these steps before generating the diagnostic report:**

1. **Enable logging:** Menu → Data → Enable Logging
2. **Reproduce the issue:** Perform at least one grind where the issue occurs
3. **Generate diagnostics:** Use one of the methods above (Web Flasher or Command Line)

The diagnostic report will automatically include your recent grind session data, which is essential for troubleshooting accuracy issues, pulse corrections, timeout problems, and other grind behavior issues. Without recent grind data, it's much harder to diagnose what's going wrong.
