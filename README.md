> [!TIP]
> **Using Home Assistant?** Add automatic discovery, live local-push sensors,
> grinder controls and firmware-update reporting with the companion
> **[Smart Grind by Weight Home Assistant integration →](https://github.com/Clinteastman/smart-grind-home-assistant)**

Turn a compatible coffee grinder into a precise, touch-controlled
grind-by-weight system using a Waveshare ESP32-S3 AMOLED board and load cell.
Smart Grind learns the grinder's live flow and stopping delay, switches the
motor off before the target, then uses controlled pulses to finish the dose.

> **Community-maintained fork.** This repository continues the
> [original Smart Grind-by-Weight project](https://github.com/jaapp/smart-grind-by-weight)
> with tested hardware support and new releases while upstream maintenance is
> limited. The original project, author and community contributors remain
> credited, and retained commits preserve their authorship.

## Features

- **Accurate grind-by-weight control** with predictive motor stopping,
  controlled finishing pulses and a configurable control tolerance of
  ±0.03 g.
- **Three editable profiles** for Single, Double and Custom doses, synchronized
  between the touchscreen and browser.
- **Target-free Manual mode** with one-tap start/stop, large optional live
  weight and TARE controls, elapsed time, motor-only lifetime accounting and an
  independent 30-second safety cutoff.
- **Grind-by-time mode** for the original timed workflow, including pause and
  resume and operation without a load cell.
- **Responsive AMOLED interface** with chart and arc views, faster partial
  display updates and reliable short-swipe gestures.
- **Adjustable coast compensation** from 70% to 150%, stored on the grinder;
  the neutral 100% default preserves the original behaviour.
- **Automatic or manual motor-latency tuning** with a guarded 30–300 ms manual
  fallback on both the touchscreen and web interface when Pulse Tune cannot
  complete reliably.
- **Configurable automatic-start threshold** for cup or portafilter detection,
  editable from the touchscreen or web interface with the original 50 g
  behaviour retained by default.
- **Built-in screensavers** plus custom RGB565 image upload and an optional
  live GaggiMate status view, with configurable brightness, startup display
  and idle timeout. An optional second delay can turn the AMOLED panel fully
  off; leaving it disabled keeps the screensaver visible indefinitely.
- **Local Wi-Fi web app** with light/dark themes, live weight and flow, saved
  dose selection, round start/stop control, settings, grind history, analytics
  and data downloads.
- **Wi-Fi setup on the device** with network scanning, a secured captive portal,
  QR access, Improv Serial provisioning and `smartgrind.local` discovery.
- **One-click firmware updates from GitHub**, with automatic stable-release
  checks, a touchscreen update indicator and on-device installer, strict V1/V2
  image selection, plus manual Wi-Fi/Bluetooth upload and USB recovery.
- **On-device diagnostics** with downloadable retained startup/runtime logs.
- **Checked settings saves and stronger fault handling**, including runtime
  save confirmation, stale-scale stops and coordinated motor/update operations.
- **V1 and V2 Waveshare support**, reproducible CI builds, a public web flasher
  and a deterministic Windows desktop simulator for development.

Network clients request a selected-profile start or stop through the same grind
controller used by the touchscreen; they never drive the relay directly. The
firmware remains responsible for load-cell checks, state transitions and motor
safety.

## Web interface

The responsive web interface is served directly by the grinder at
`http://smartgrind.local`; no cloud account or separate application is needed.
Choose a saved dose, start or stop it with the round grind control, follow the
current grind, review its full recorded trace, change grinder/display settings
and install the latest stable firmware from a browser on the same network. The
System & updates page checks this project's GitHub releases and selects the
matching V1 or V2 application image automatically; manual upload remains
available as an advanced fallback. The grinder also checks in the background
while idle: a green refresh symbol appears when an update is ready, and either
that symbol or **Menu → Wi-Fi → Install update** starts the same guarded update
flow. If mDNS is unavailable, use the IP address shown on the grinder's Wi-Fi
screen.

The grinder retains the latest 10 logged sessions with accuracy, consistency,
weight and flow data. Each session can be downloaded as CSV, JSON or its
original raw record. BLE export and the Python analysis tools remain available
for longer-term archives and recovery workflows.

## Quick start

> [!CAUTION]
> This is an experimental mains-powered appliance modification. Disconnect the
> grinder from power before opening it, preserve protective earth and insulation,
> and ask a qualified person to handle mains wiring if you are not competent to
> do so. Build and use it at your own risk.

1. **Check compatibility and collect the parts.** Start with the
   [parts list](docs/HARDWARE_INSTALLATION.md#parts-list) and
   [grinder compatibility matrix](docs/GRINDER_COMPATIBILITY.md).
2. **Print the mounting parts.** Use the included STL files and review the
   [community 3D-print designs](docs/3D_PRINTS.md).
3. **Identify the controller generation before flashing.** The 1.64-inch V1
   and V2 boards require different display firmware and external GPIO wiring.
   Do not rely on the ambiguous `Rev1.1` PCB text alone; use the photographs and
   connector/component checks in
   [Display stays black after flashing](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md#display-stays-black-after-flashing-waveshare-164-v2).
4. **Flash the matching image.** Open the
   [Community Web Flasher](https://clinteastman.github.io/smart-grind-by-weight/)
   in Chrome or Edge on desktop/Android and explicitly select V1 or V2. USB
   recovery instructions and command-line alternatives are in the
   [development guide](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md).
5. **Wire, assemble and calibrate.** Follow the ordered
   [build and installation checklist](docs/DOC.md#start-here) and the
   [Eureka build video](https://youtu.be/-kfKjiwJsGM). On the verified V2
   installation, HX711 SCK is GPIO1 and the motor relay is GPIO16; GPIO18 is
   reserved by the touch controller.

The original timed mode remains available, and the documented Eureka
installation can be reversed without permanently modifying the grinder body.

For an uncomplicated target-free run, swipe to **Manual**, the first main-screen
page. If a scale is fitted, place the empty cup on it and tap **TARE**, then tap
**START**. Tap **STOP** when enough coffee has been ground. The large live weight
remains available before and after grinding. Manual mode never requires or
automatically tares the load cell and stops automatically after 30 seconds.

## How grinding works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  start((Start)) --> T[Tare]
  T --> E[Predictive grind<br/>learn flow and stopping delay]
  E --> S[Settle]
  S --> P[Controlled pulse]
  P -->|within tolerance, overshot,<br/>or pulse limit reached| C[Complete]
  P -->|more coffee needed| S
```

The controller learns flow and motor latency during each grind, predicts when
to stop before the requested weight, then evaluates the settled dose. Short,
bounded pulses finish an under-target dose without requiring a pre-trained bean
or grind-size profile. Coast compensation lets experienced users scale the
latency estimate while leaving the neutral default unchanged. **Menu → Tune
Pulses** remains the recommended way to measure minimum pulse latency; the same
stored value can be adjusted manually under **Grind Settings** when automatic
tuning is unavailable.

## Community development status

The released baseline supports both V1 and V2, with separate firmware builds.
The 1.5.8 candidate passed supervised V2 Wi-Fi installation, an 18 g grind with
saved history, and a live-settings check. Community V1 hardware testing is
welcome. See [release validation](docs/RELIABILITY_RELEASE.md) for coverage limits.

The [community roadmap](docs/COMMUNITY_ROADMAP.md) records the detailed delivery
status, reviewed upstream work and contribution plan. The independently
implemented [Wi-Fi, Web and Home Assistant architecture](docs/WIFI_ARCHITECTURE.md)
uses lessons from mature ESP32 appliance projects without copying their source.

## Development and contributing

See [DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) for the ESP-IDF build variants,
simulator, tests and contribution workflow. Build and flash operations use a
project lock, and each firmware variant builds in its own directory with its
own configuration, so board-specific LVGL objects never mix.

The complete editable Fusion 360 design is included at
`3d_files/smart-grind-by-weight. Eureka Mignon.f3z`.

Please report reproducible problems through
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Clinteastman/smart-grind-by-weight/issues),
including the board generation, firmware version and a diagnostic log where
possible. Tested V1 hardware feedback is particularly useful.
